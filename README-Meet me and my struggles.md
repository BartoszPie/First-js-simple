## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

### What I learned

This is my first project where I used Js. Not complicated but I am ready to learn and use more of it :D

I experimented with few codes and hopefully chose the best option.

### Continued development

In the future projects I want to focus on semantic HTML and much more Js functions - I really like them :D
